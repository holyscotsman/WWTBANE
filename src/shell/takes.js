// A SCENE is a playlist of TAKES. Looping scenes are ambient backgrounds; a
// trigger cuts to a one-shot scene, which then returns to the interrupted
// background (or advances to `next`). Durations are seconds.
//
// Take types (evaluated by src/shell/director.js):
//   { type:'orbit',  dur, center:[x,y,z], radius, height, from, to, look:[x,y,z] }
//       — circles `center` at `radius`/`height`, sweeping `from`→`to` degrees
//   { type:'dolly',  dur, from:{p,t}, to:{p,t} }
//       — glides camera position p and look-target t between two poses
//   { type:'pan',    dur, p:[x,y,z], from:[x,y,z], to:[x,y,z] }
//       — camera fixed at p; the look-target sweeps from→to (pans and tilts)
//   { type:'static', dur, p:[x,y,z], t:[x,y,z] }
//       — locked-off shot
//
// Stage geography (see studio.js): stage center [0,~1,0]; console at center;
