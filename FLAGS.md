# FLAGS.md — blockers & questions for the human

Things the autonomous loop **cannot** decide. Nothing here blocks a playable
ship, but each wants a human before it's "done" per `CLAUDE.md`.

## 1. Question bank — being replaced with owner-authored content
- **Status:** the owner is supplying their **own** question bank (some items
  with images), to replace the current 157 AI-drafted questions. The ingestion
  path is built: author in Markdown per `docs/QUESTION_AUTHORING.md`, then
  `npm run import:questions <file.md>` regenerates `src/content/questions.js`
  (schema-validated; won't ship a broken key). Owner questions import as
  `reviewStatus:"human-reviewed"`.
- **What's left:** the owner uploads the Markdown (+ image files); the current
  AI-drafted bank stands in until then. Once imported, this flag is cleared —
  the bank becomes human-authored, which is what §4/§7 require.
- **Note:** the **runtime never uses AI to grade** — correctness is decided
  solely by the stored authored key, before and after the swap.

## 2. Host dialogue — intro cinematic, welcome lines, quips (authored content)
- **What:** the first-run cinematic (`src/shell/ui/cinematic.js`) contains host
  dialogue: the studio tour lines and the guided tutorial that walks the player
  through the UI and reveals the first question's answer. The welcome-back
  lines (including the snarky set) and per-question quips in
  `src/shell/hostLines.js` are the same category — game-mechanics banter,
  AI-drafted at the owner's explicit request, awaiting a human read.
- **Why flagged:** `CLAUDE.md §7` reserves host dialogue for a human. These
  lines were AI-drafted at the owner's explicit request ("the host explains how
  to play") — they are game-mechanics narration, not exam teaching — but still
  warrant a human read-through for voice and tone.
- **Integrity note:** the tutorial's revealed answer marks Q1 as assisted, so
  the freebie never promotes mastery.

## 3. Palette identity (inherited, unconfirmed)
- The Iris/Aqua/Mantis/Peach/Gold palette is inherited from StarNix and used
  throughout. `CLAUDE.md §6/§8` flag it for confirmation: keep it, or define
  WWTBANE's own identity?

## 4. Studio visual sign-off
- The WebGL studio is **code-complete, visual-pending**. It passes structural
  and interaction tests but needs a human's eyes. Tracked in `BROWSER_QA.md`.

## 5. Exam version scope
- Content targets **AOS 6.x / Prism / AHV** (broad NCP-MCI). If you want to pin a
  specific exam blueprint version, say which and the bank can be curated to it.

## 6. Character models — code-built upgrade shipped; imports need a rules change
- The owner asked twice about using "a 3D digital asset" for the people. The
  shipped answer: **proportioned capsule-built people** (skin/hair/clothes/
  faces, posable arms, readable hot seats) drawn in code — because the brand
  rule is original art in code, imported model files carry licensing risk,
  and a static Pages site should stay lean. If the owner still wants imported
  GLB/FBX assets after seeing these, that is an explicit change to the
  CLAUDE.md §6 brand rule and needs their sign-off (plus a vetted-license
  asset source) first.

## 7. Easy-tier difficulty calibration
- The owner asked whether the easy round is easy enough, and whether the
  questions were owner-supplied. They were **not** — the owner never provided
  questions; the whole bank is AI-drafted pending human review (flag #1).
  The authored `easy` labels are cold-start seeds only; if the owner wants a
  gentler on-ramp, a human pass should re-grade the easy pool (or supply
  replacement questions) — difficulty values are human-authored content per
  `CLAUDE.md §7`.

## Resolved
- _none yet._
